Abstract associated with the publication: <br />
The persistence of reef-building corals in the Anthropocene is shaped by an interplay between their holobiont constituents (coral animals and their microbial symbionts) and environment. Environmental parameters such as diel temperature variability (DTV) can promote thermal tolerance, but the extent to which DTV interacts with holobiont partners to shape coral responses to thermal challenge remains unclear. We characterized how holobiont genetics and DTV influence thermal challenge responses by exposing the coral Siderastrea siderea to different levels of DTV, followed by a heat challenge and recovery period. Unexpectedly, we uncovered three cryptic S. siderea lineages that exhibited unique skeletal morphologies and diverse algal partnerships. Together, these differences likely contribute to the distinct lineage distributions across inshore and offshore environments. While cryptic lineages primarily drove holobiont phenomes, DTV promoted growth regardless of lineage. These results highlight ecological specialization of cryptic lineages and showcase how unique host-symbiont pairings and thermal variability shape responses to thermal challenge, with broad implications for reef conservation.

This repository is organized such that each folder contains the data (or details on where to access the data) and code needed to recreate all analyses presented in the manuscript, including the the 2bRADseq population genetic analyses, ITS2 and 16S metabarcoding analyses, and coral host and symbiont physiology analyses. 

All raw sequencing files have been uploaded to NCBI's SRA (2bRAD BioProject ID=PRJNA973074, 16S/ITS2 BioProject ID= PRJNA973086).
